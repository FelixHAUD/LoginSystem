# Simulated Login System

This is a simulated login system using Python and SQLite3 to practice SQL queries. It uses a basic python input interface to interact with a SQLite database that contains a password, username, email, and user_id. The password is hash encoded to ensure basic security.  

# What can be improved on?

The password safety could be improved on heavily. There is no actual "security" or firewall behind this. 
Also, can work on connecting a real front-end instead of a python input interface. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development purposes.
